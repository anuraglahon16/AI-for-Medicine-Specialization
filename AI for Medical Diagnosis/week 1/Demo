In this course, just in the first week, you will build a deep learning model that can interpret chest X-rays to classify different diseases.
Let me share with you a demo of what your model will be able to do. Here we have a chest X-ray. Chest X-ray is the most commonly performed Imaging exam in the world 
and used to diagnose and treat a variety of diseases. This is a chest X-ray of a patient
who has fluid in their lungs. When you train your model in assignment 1 it will be able to pick up this abnormality. Let's see it in action.

So here I've just run this image of the chest X-ray to a deep learning model on my phone. The model processes this chest X-ray and recognizes 
that this patient's X-ray is abnormal. More specifically, when I scroll down it's found that the patient likely has fluid in their lungs. This condition is called edema.
In course three you'll learn about how you can generate these heat maps that show where in the image the model is finding evidence of the disease.
In this course, you'll learn about and apply all the core concepts to build such a model using real data.
